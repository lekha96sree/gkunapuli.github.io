My research interests include human-in-the-loop learning, knowledge-based and advice-taking learning algorithms, scalable and efficient learning algorithms, domain adaptation and non-convex optimization; with applications in large-scale medical informatics, social networking, text analytics, behavior mining and educational data mining.

I was previously Research Associate Professor (now Adjunct Faculty) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), and a member of the the Statistical Artificial Intelligence and Relational Learning Group ([Starling Lab](https://starling.utdallas.edu/)).
